These are all SmolAgents projects I followed from YouTube and Hugging Face documentation  The Youtube Link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7qFVrpLh34&t=737s&ab_channel=TylerAI , some of the code is outdated so you will need to reference the documentation, the #model lines in first and second are commented out to make it easy to push on GitHub but you have to uncomment them. You also need a Hugging Face inference tokenand a sandbox token in your ENV file when you want to run their projects
